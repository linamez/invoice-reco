# Invoice Recognition

Starting project with RÃ‰MI: a FastAPI-based backend for with invoice recognition using GPT.

## Starting the FastAPI Backend

This section guides you through setting up and running the FastAPI backend for your project.
Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

* Python 3.10 or higher
* `pip` (Python package installer)

## Installation

1. Clone the Repository
2. If you haven't already, clone the project repository to your local machine using Git:


   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/linamez/invoice-reco 
   cd invoice-repo
   ```

3. Create a Virtual Environment and install dependencies

   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:

     ```bash
     poetry shell
     ```

### Running the Server

1. **Start the FastAPI Server**  
   Run the FastAPI server using `uvicorn`:

   ```bash
   uvicorn invoice_reco:app --reload
   ```

2. **Access the API**  
   Once the server is running, you can access the API at: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000). Use this base URL to make requests to your API endpoints.

### Starting the page

Open with your navigator the file `public/index.html`.

### Testing

```bash
pytest tests
```

## Next Steps

- Explore the API documentation automatically generated by FastAPI at [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs).
- Start building your API endpoints by editing `main.py` and any other relevant files in your project.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while starting the server, ensure you've activated the virtual environment and that all dependencies are correctly installed. For more specific problems, consult the FastAPI documentation or seek help from your team!
